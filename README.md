# 2-assessment-challenge

Hey Millie, Joel, and Ryan,
   I really struggled with this assignment; I thought I was understanding jquery, but when it came down to it with this assignment, I could not get any of the buttons to do anything....I tried a lot of different ways, kind of gost lost in my trials, and feel dumb that I could not even get one thing to work!
   
I'm going to keep working on it this weekend....
